# Trumping Principles

## Strict Prohibition of Lying

![Strict Prohibition of Lying](./Graphics/prohibition-to-lie.png)

The argument:

(1) If you choose the option "lying" you will lie to your friend.

(2) Lying is morally prohibited independently of its consequences.

---

(3) If you choose the option "lying", you conduct an action which is morally prohibited.

(4) Morally prohibited actiions ought to be avoided [Principle of moral consistency]

---

(5) You should avoid the option "lying".

Problem of the argument: 

* the constructed principle in premise (2) is unconvincing. We can easily provide examples in which a morally adequate action violates this principle.
