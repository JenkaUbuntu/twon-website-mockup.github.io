The resulting decision rules are:\n\nTrumping Principles\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro Truth-Sticking (contra lying)\nPro Lying (contra truth-sticking)\n\n\n\n\nDesire-Fulfillment If it does not cause inappropriate costs to you, you should always fulfill the articulated desires of your friend, even if they can substantially harm your friend.\nAvoidance of Harm If it does not cause inappropriate costs to you, you should choose the action which minimizes the expected harm to your friend, even if you break established social norms thereby.\n\n\nRespecting Autonomy If it does not cause inappropriate costs to you, you should always respect the autonomy of your friend, even if the respective actions can substantially harm your friend.\n\n\n\nSupporting a sincere relationship If it does not cause inappropriate costs to you, you should always choose the action which preserves a sincere relationship with your friend, even if the respective actions can substantially harm your friend.\n\n\n\nSupporting social practice You should always tell the truth, even if the corresponding actions cause susbtantial harm to your friend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBalancing\nIf there are both prima facie reasons for truth-telling and for lying, and none of these reasons trumps the opposite, the prima facie reasons must be weighed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximizing Expected Value pro Lying\n\n\n\n\nThe expected harm for your friend from missing the meeting is higher than the harm to her caused by the unfulfilled desire, by the disregard of her autonomy, by the stress caused to your relationship, and by a violation of the social practice of honesty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximizing Expected Value pro Truth-Sticking\n\n\n\n\nThe expected harm for your friend from missing the meeting is lower than the aggregated harm to her and to society which results from your friend’s frustrated desire, disregard of her autonomy, the stress caused to your relationship, and a violation of the social practice of honesty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrecautionary Principle pro Truth-Sticking\n\n\n\n\nXYz\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrecautionary Principle pro Lying\n\n\n\n\nXYz\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvaluation of the Decision Rules\nLinked sub-sides:\n\nTrumping Arguments-internal-link\nBalancing Arguments-internal\nDebunking Arguments\n\n\nSub-Side Argumentation Analysis (?)"
