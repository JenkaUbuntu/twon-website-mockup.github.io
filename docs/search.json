If this turns out to be the case, this would provide a weighty reason for a free public access to TWONs.\nIt is possible that access to TWONs, restricted to approved researchers, is sufficient to control the algorithms of online social networks. This, in turn, would provide a weighty reason for restricting TWON’s availability to a group of researchers.\nSince it is unclear which of these possibilities is true, it is impossible to rule out one of the governance modes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsight 4: Some premises in the justifications of different governance modes are uncertain. It is imperative that these premises be addressed by future research or thorough deliberation in order to enable an informed decision regarding the deployment of TWONs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmpirical UncertaintiesEthical Uncertainties\n\n\n\nFeasibility of regulating access to TWONs: It is currently uncertain if it will be practically possible to restrict access to TWONs. This depends on the complexity of underlying technology (if, after the bluepring for the underlying models has been developed, anybody with sufficient financial and/or computational resources can set up TWONs, it is unlikely that access restrictions will become enforcable) and on the amount of personal data from an online social network needed for a reliable simulation.\nAvailability of alternative means for safeguarding democratic values and enforcing legislation on online social networks: the recently adopted legislation in the EU (namely, the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA)) is designed to regulate the activities of large online platforms. Nevertheless, it is currently unclear to what extent these acts can be enforced. It may be the case that an instrument such as a TWON is required for the two acts to become legally effective.\n\n\n\n\nQuantification of the extent to which norms, values, and rights worthy of protection (such as democratic self-determination, individual autonomy, the right to informational self-determination) are jeopardized by online social networks: the decision regarding the governance of TWONs is contingent upon the extent to which these values are threatened by the prevailing online social networks and the diverse governance modes of TWONs. At the moment, no comparisons of the threads are available.\nHow should the differences in the potential benefits and risks of different modes of gorvernance of TWONs be weighed? Unrestricted public access promises the highest economic benefits from TWONs, but this mode of governance is also associated with the highest risks. The stricter the regulation of TWONs is, the lower are as the expected economic benefits as the risks. Assessments of societal risks and benefits are often highly controversial within a society.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsight 5: If TWONs turn out to be a technology that requires strict regulation, the research and development process must also be subject to regulatory oversight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsight 6: At the moment, it is unclear how much a TWON’s ability to inform the regulation of online social networks hinges on detailed personal data about individual users. By means of modeling of fictional reality, however, the reliance on personal data can be rigorously quantified."

    "text": "Balancing Arguments for Truth-Sticking\nIf there are both prima facie reasons for truth-telling and for lying, the prima facie reasons must be weighed. An argument based on weighing pro- and contra considerations that supports truth-sticking must claim that the considerations pro truth-sticking outweigh the prima facie reason against it. There are two general strategies how such a weighing can be justified:\n\nsalient-reason argumentation: by providing a salient reason for truth-sticking\nconsequentialist argumentation: by taking the value of the consequences as the decisive consideration\n\n\nSalient-Reason Argumentation\n\nIdea of the ArgumentsReconstructed ArgumentsMap of the Arguments\n\n\nThis type of argumentation is based on the idea that particular prima facie-reasons for truth-sticking have such importance that they outweigh the expected harm from truth-sticking. The rationale of the arguments is that the expected harm is less significant for the friend is not deprived of the opportunity to avoid the harm. She is in certain sense responsible for its occurrence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutonomy-Argument\n\n\n\n\n\nSituation S: the choice situation as described here\n\nIf you tell the truth in the situation S, it is reasonable to expect that your friend will be substantially harmed.\nIf you lie in the situation S, you will infringe the autonomy of your friend.\nIf you tell the truth in the situation S, your friend will have the ability to avoid that she will be harmed.\nIf you have the ability to manipulate the behaviour of a person A such as to avoid that A will be harmed but A has the ability to avoid that she will be harmed without your manipulation as well, you ought to refrain from manipulating A’s behaviour.\n\n\n\n[Conclusion]: You ought to refrain from lying.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesire-Fullfillment Argument\n\n\n\n\n\nSituation S: the choice situation as described here\n\nIf you tell the truth in the situation S, it is reasonable to expect that your friend will be substantially harmed.\nIf you lie in the situation S, you will be violating your friend’s articulated desire.\nIf you tell the truth in the situation S, your friend will have the ability to avoid that she will be harmed.\nIf you have the ability to fulfil an articulated desire of your friend, the fulfilment of which may reasonably cause harm to your friend, but it is within your friend’s power to avoid the harm from the fulfilemt of the desire, you ought to fulfil your friend’s desire unless there are more other significant reasons against doing so.\nThere are no other significant reasons against your fulfilling your friend’s desire.\n\n\n\n[Conclusion]: You ought to refrain from lying.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArgument from Sincere Friendship\n\n\n\n\n\nSituation S: the choice situation as described here\n\nIf you tell the truth in the situation S, you will fail to avoid for sure that your friend will be substantially harmed.\nIf you tell the truth in the situation S, your friend will have the ability to avoid that she will be harmed.\nIf you lie in the situation S, you will create a precedent that you do not always behave as a practice of sincere friendship requires.\nMaintaining the practice of sincere friendship with your friend is of such importance that you ought not to jeopardise the functioning of the practice by failing to avoid harm that is within your friend’s power to avoid unless there are more important reasons for jeopardising your sincere friendship.\nThere are no more important reasons for jeopardising the friendship.\n\n\n\n[Conclusion]: You ought to refrain from lying.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsequentialist Argumentation\n\nIdea of the ArgumentsReconstructed ArgumentsMap of the Arguments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTruth-Sticking Maximizes Expected Goodness\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTruth-Sticking under Uncertainty",
