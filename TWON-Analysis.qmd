# Your Evaluation based on the pro- and cons lists

* Step 1: Evaluation of prima facie reasons
  * Possible Benefits: Which of the possible benefits are not prima facie reasons for a free access to TWONs? 
    * possible outcomes: (i-pro) all pro-reasons debunked; (ii-pro) some or none pro-reasons debunked
  * Possible Harms: Which of the risks are not prima facie reasons against a free access to TWON?
    * possible outcomes: (i-contra) all debunked;
    (ii-contra): some or none debunked.
  * if (i-pro)&(i-contra): no reasoning on the basis of our pro-cons list possible -- a new pro-con list needed
  * otherwise: Step 2: Decision Principles

* Step 2: Decision Principles
  * if (i-pro)&(ii-Contra): contra-reasons trump
    * Free Access has risks and no benefits
    * Create the map
  * if (ii-pro)&(i-contra): pro-reasons trump
    * Free Access has benefits and no risks
    * Additional premise needed: there are no alternatives
      * Evaluate it: agree, disagree, do not know
      * Result: 
  * if (ii-pro)&(ii-contra: )
