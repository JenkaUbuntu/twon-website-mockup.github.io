title: Step 2 - Construction of Arguments
---

::: {.callout-warning icon="false" collapse="true"}
# Theoretical Background

Construction of arguments is a creative task which involves several trial-and-error attempts. There is a formal requirement which a deductively valid construction must meet:

* find premises such that the respective prima facie reason is represented in at least one premise and that the respective conclusion deductively follows from all premises. 

* The formal requirement is necessary but not sufficient for an argument to be plausible: we can find a large number of principles which guarantee a deductively valid inference to a conclustion (in our case: one of the options for action). These principles differ, however, in their plausibility, as the exmaples below demonstrate.

### Idea of the Arguments
This argumentation strategy is based on the idea that the prima facie reason for lying -- avoiding harm to your friend -- does not hold.

### Reconstruction of Arguments

The Debunking-Argumentation consists of two crucial steps:

1. An argument attacking the prima facie reasons supporting lying. In our case there is only one pro-lying reason "Avoidance of Harm". **A1: Debunking the prima facie reason for lying** attacks it.

2. The argument supporting the main claim ("Stick to Truth!"). It is reconstructed as **A2: There are no reasons against truth-sticking"**.

# A1: Debunking the pf-reason for lying

|:-:|:-------------------------|
|(1)|[**You cannot deceive your friend**]: Your friend reliably recognizes when you are not sincere to her. |
|(2)|If your friend recognizes that your recommendation for public transport is not sincere, she will not trust your advise.|
|(3)|If your friend does not trust your advise, it is not the case that by telling that the earlier connection is the last one you avoid for sure that your friend is significantly harmed.|

|(4)| [Conclusion]: It is not the case that by telling that the earlier connection is the last one you avoid for sure that your friend is significantly harmed.|

# A2: There are no reasons against truth-sticking

|:-:|:-------------------------|
|(1)|There are only two options for action: sticking to truth or lying.|
|(2)|By telling the truth, you respect your friend's autonomy, satisfies her desires, avoid mistrust in your relationship, support a highly important social practice.|
|(3)|If you lie, there are no advantages.|
| |  <-- Premise (3) is justified by the Argument 1 |
|(4)|If there are only two options for action, and the one option realizes imporant benefits and the other none, the first option should be chosen. |

## Balancing Arguments for Truth-Sticking

If there are both prima facie reasons for truth-telling and for lying, the prima facie reasons must be weighed. An argument based on weighing pro- and contra considerations that supports truth-sticking must claim that the considerations pro truth-sticking outweigh the prima facie reason against it. There are two general strategies how such a weighing can be justified:

* **salient-reason argumentation**: by providing a salient reason for truth-sticking
* **consequentialist argumentation**: by taking the value of the consequences as the decisive consideration

### Salient-Reason Argumentation 

::::: {.panel-tabset}

#### Idea of the Arguments
This type of argumentation is based on the idea that particular [prima facie-reasons for truth-sticking](./arg-anal-pf-reasons-example.qmd) have such importance that they outweigh the expected harm from truth-sticking. The rationale of the arguments is that the expected harm is less significant for the friend is not deprived of the opportunity to avoid the harm. She is in certain sense responsible for its occurrence.  

#### Reconstructed Arguments

::: {.callout-warning icon="false" collapse="true"}
#### Autonomy-Argument

Situation S: the choice situation as [described here](./Arg-Anal-Method.qmd)

1. If you tell the truth in the situation S, it is reasonable to expect that your friend will be substantially harmed. 
2. If you lie in the situation S, you will infringe the autonomy of your friend.
3. If you tell the truth in the situation S, your friend will have the ability to avoid that she will be harmed.
4. If you have the ability to manipulate the behaviour of a person A such as to avoid that A will be harmed but A has the ability to avoid that she will be harmed without your manipulation as well, you ought to refrain from manipulating A's behaviour. 

----

5. **[Conclusion]**: You ought to refrain from lying.

#### Desire-Fullfillment Argument

Situation S: the choice situation as [described here](./Arg-Anal-Method.qmd)

1. If you tell the truth in the situation S, it is reasonable to expect that your friend will be substantially harmed. 
2. If you lie in the situation S, you will be violating your friend's articulated desire.
3. If you tell the truth in the situation S, your friend will have the ability to avoid that she will be harmed.
4. If you have the ability to fulfil an articulated desire of your friend, the fulfilment of which may reasonably cause harm to your friend, but it is within your friend's power to avoid the harm from the fulfilemt of the desire, you ought to fulfil your friend's desire unless there are more other significant reasons against doing so.
5. There are no other significant reasons against your fulfilling your friend's desire. 

----

5. **[Conclusion]**: You ought to refrain from lying.

#### Argument from Sincere Friendship

Situation S: the choice situation as [described here](./Arg-Anal-Method.qmd)

1. If you tell the truth in the situation S, you will fail to avoid for sure that your friend will be substantially harmed. 
3. If you tell the truth in the situation S, your friend will have the ability to avoid that she will be harmed.
2. If you lie in the situation S, you will create a precedent that you do not always behave as a practice of sincere friendship requires.
4. Maintaining the practice of sincere friendship with your friend is of such importance that you ought not to jeopardise the functioning of the practice by failing to avoid harm that is within your friend's power to avoid unless there are more important reasons for jeopardising your sincere friendship.
5. There are no more important reasons for jeopardising the friendship. 

----

5. **[Conclusion]**: You ought to refrain from lying.

| The expected harm for your friend from missing the meeting is higher than the harm to her caused by the unfulfilled desire, by the disregard of her autonomy, by the stress caused to your relationship, and by a violation of the social practice of honesty. |
