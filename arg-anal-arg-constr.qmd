title: Step 2 - Construction of Arguments

::: {.callout-warning icon="false" collapse="true"}
# Theoretical Background

Construction of arguments is a creative task which involves several trial-and-error attempts. There is a formal requirement which a deductively valid construction must meet:

* find premises such that the respective prima facie reason is represented in at least one premise and that the respective conclusion deductively follows from all premises. 

* The formal requirement is necessary but not sufficient for an argument to be plausible: we can find a large number of principles which guarantee a deductively valid inference to a conclustion (in our case: one of the options for action). These principles differ, however, in their plausibility, as the exmaples below demonstrate.

## Debunking Argumentation for Truth-Sticking

This argumentation strategy is based on the idea that the prima facie reason for lying -- avoiding harm to your friend -- does not hold.

### Reconstruction of Arguments

The Debunking-Argumentation consists of two crucial steps:

1. An argument attacking the prima facie reasons supporting lying. In our case there is only one pro-lying reason "Avoidance of Harm". **A1: Debunking the prima facie reason for lying** attacks it.

2. The argument supporting the main claim ("Stick to Truth!"). It is reconstructed as **A2: There are no reasons against truth-sticking"**.

# A1: Debunking the pf-reason for lying

|:-:|:-------------------------|
|(1)|[**You cannot deceive your friend**]: Your friend reliably recognizes when you are not sincere to her. |
|(2)|If your friend recognizes that your recommendation for public transport is not sincere, she will not trust your advise.|
|(3)|If your friend does not trust your advise, it is not the case that by telling that the earlier connection is the last one you avoid for sure that your friend is significantly harmed.|

|(4)| [Conclusion]: It is not the case that by telling that the earlier connection is the last one you avoid for sure that your friend is significantly harmed.|

# A2: There are no reasons against truth-sticking

| | |
|:-:|:-------------------------|
|(1)|There are only two options for action: sticking to truth or lying.|
|(2)|By telling the truth, you respect your friend's autonomy, satisfies her desires, avoid mistrust in your relationship, support a highly important social practice.|
|(3)|If you lie, there are no advantages.|
| |  <-- Premise (3) is justified by the Argument 1 |
|(4)|If there are only two options for action, and the one option realizes imporant benefits and the other none, the first option should be chosen. |

## Balancing Arguments for Truth-Sticking

If there are both prima facie reasons for truth-telling and for lying, the prima facie reasons must be weighed. 

### Trumping 

| Pro Truth-Sticking (contra lying) | Pro Lying (contra truth-sticking) |
|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Desire-Fulfillment** If it does not cause inappropriate costs to you, you should always fulfill the articulated desires of your friend, even if they can substantially harm your friend. | **Avoidance of Harm**  If it does not cause inappropriate costs to you, you should choose the action which minimizes the expected harm to your friend, even if you break established social norms thereby. |
| **Respecting Autonomy** If it does not cause inappropriate costs to you, you should always respect the autonomy of your friend, even if the respective actions can substantially harm your friend. |  |
| **Supporting a sincere relationship** If it does not cause inappropriate costs to you, you should always choose the action which preserves a sincere relationship with your friend, even if the respective actions can substantially harm your friend. | |
| **Supporting social practice** You should always tell the truth, even if the corresponding actions cause susbtantial harm to your friend. | |

### Balancing

| Maximizing Expected Value pro Lying |
|:-----|
| The expected harm for your friend from missing the meeting is higher than the harm to her caused by the unfulfilled desire, by the disregard of her autonomy, by the stress caused to your relationship, and by a violation of the social practice of honesty. |

| Maximizing Expected Value pro Truth-Sticking |
|:-----|
| The expected harm for your friend from missing the meeting is lower  than the aggregated harm to her and to society which results from your friend's frustrated desire, disregard of her autonomy, the stress caused to your relationship, and a violation of the social practice of honesty. |
