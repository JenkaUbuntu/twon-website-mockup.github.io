---

::: {.callout-warning icon="false" collapse="true"}
# Theoretical Background
Compile a list of all prima facie reasons that support the available options for action. </br>
Compiling a list usually involves several steps: 

1. one starts with collecting candidates for prima reasons in favour of all options for action;
2. one reflects on which of these candidates are genuine reasons and reduces the candidates-list from (1) to an often reduced list of prima facie reasons. 
:::

Here is an example for how a list of prima facie reasons in our example could look like.
