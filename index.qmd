### A Problem with Online Social Networks
![Problem with Online Social Networks](./Graphics/osn-problem-cropped.svg)
<!--
* OSNs are associated with societally problematic outcomes: 
  * hate speach, 
  * polarization, 
  * fake news, 
  * political riots
  * ...
* Public discourse: 
  * it remains controversial who is responsible for these outcomes:
     * critical public: OSNs and their algorithms are responsible
     * OSN providers: users are responsible
  * the available data does not allow to find out who is right
* Outcome of the public discourse: 
  * stalemate in regulation of OSNs
  -->

### The Solution: TWONs
![A way to find out how to regulate OSNs -- TWONs](./Graphics/conseq-twon-cropped.svg)

* TWON: Twin of an Online Social Network
  * Twin: a precise model
  * TWONs: digital copies of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok etc.
* TWONs would allow:
  * identification of algorithms of the original OSNs
  * prediction of hate speach clusters, polarization etc.
  * reconstruction of causal effects: who has caused certain problematic outcomes

* TWONs pose own risks:
  * misuse of TWONs for individual interests by powerful agents:
    * increase in manipulation, fake news etc. 
    * reinforcement of existing inequalities

### Ethical Challenge
![Resulting ethical challenge regarding TWONs](./Graphics/ethical-question-g163.svg)

* a technology (OSNs such as Facebook, Twitter etc.) is associated with strongly undesired societal outcomes.
* to find out if and how to regulate the problematic technology, a second technology -- twins of OSNs -- are build.
* the intention is to find by the means of the new technology how to prevent the undesired outcomes.
* but it could turn out that the new technology reinforces the undesired outcomes of the original technology.
